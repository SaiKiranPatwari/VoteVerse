**VoteVerse** (by StrawHats)is a group-based polling platform. It allows users to create and join groups, post polls with questions, images, and voting options, and receive notifications when polls conclude. Built using React for the frontend and Golang for the backend, the platform emphasizes scalability, responsiveness, and real-time updates.
