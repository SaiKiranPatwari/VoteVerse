# VoteVerse Backend - Sprint 3 Plan

## Sprint Overview

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Focus**: Testing, Security, and Scalability  
**Goal**: Ensure the backend application is fully tested, secure, and ready for production deployment

## Key Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**

   - Implement unit tests for all services and controllers
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints
   - Set up automated testing pipeline

2. **Security Enhancements**

   - Implement robust authentication and authorization
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Protect against common web vulnerabilities

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Set up monitoring and logging

4. **API Documentation and Refinement**
   - Complete OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
   - Standardize API responses
   - Implement versioning strategy

## Detailed Tasks

### Testing (High Priority)

- [ ] Set up testing framework with Jest
- [ ] Create test database setup and teardown scripts
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all services:
  - [ ] Authentication service
  - [ ] User service
  - [ ] Group service
  - [ ] Poll service
  - [ ] Comment service
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Security (High Priority)

- [ ] Audit and enhance JWT implementation
- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement input validation for all API endpoints
- [ ] Set up CORS properly
- [ ] Add protection against SQL injection
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Create security headers configuration
- [ ] Set up security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Implement query caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add Redis for session management and caching
- [ ] Set up database connection pooling
- [ ] Implement pagination for list endpoints
- [ ] Create database query monitoring
- [ ] Set up performance benchmarking

### API Refinement (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Complete OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Standardize error responses
- [ ] Implement consistent pagination
- [ ] Add filtering and sorting capabilities to list endpoints
- [ ] Create API versioning strategy
- [ ] Implement request validation middleware
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging

### Deployment and DevOps (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Create Docker configuration for production
- [ ] Set up database migration scripts
- [ ] Implement environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement automated backup strategy

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test individual services and functions in isolation
- Mock external dependencies and database
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### Integration Testing

- Test API endpoints with a test database
- Verify request/response cycles
- Test authentication and authorization
- Ensure proper data persistence

### Performance Testing

- Benchmark API response times
- Test under various load conditions
- Identify and resolve bottlenecks
- Verify caching effectiveness

## Definition of Done

- All tests pass with >80% code coverage
- All endpoints properly documented in OpenAPI/Swagger
- Security audit passes with no critical issues
- API response times under 200ms for standard operations
- All features documented
- Code reviewed and approved

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Database performance issues under load
  - **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing, caching, and query optimization
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Regular security audits, follow OWASP guidelines
- **Risk**: API changes breaking frontend functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Versioning strategy, comprehensive testing with frontend
